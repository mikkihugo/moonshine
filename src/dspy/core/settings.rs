//! # DSPy Settings: Global Configuration Management
//!
//! This module provides a mechanism for managing global settings within the DSPy framework,
//! specifically for the Language Model (LM) and its associated `Adapter`. It uses a
//! `LazyLock` and `RwLock` to ensure safe and efficient access to these shared resources
//! across different parts of the application.
//!
//! The `configure` function is the primary entry point for initializing DSPy's global state,
//! making the configured LM and Adapter available for all DSPy modules.
//!
