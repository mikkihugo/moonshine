# ‚ú® MOON SHINE - Shine Code to Production Excellence

## üìñ Package Documentation

**For complete documentation, see [README.md](./README.md) in this directory.**

## üéØ Package Role

**Moon Extension for Shining Code to Production Excellence** - Hybrid WASM extension + Moon tasks for moonrepo:

- **üß† AI-Powered Analysis**: Claude CLI provides intelligent fix suggestions via Moon tasks - WASM coordinates workflow
- **üåô Moon Native**: WASM extension coordinates with Moon tasks for native tool execution (tsc, eslint, prettier, claude)
- **‚ö° Hybrid Architecture**: WASM for coordination + Moon tasks for tool execution (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Claude CLI)
- **üîÑ JSON Communication**: Structured protocol between WASM extension and Moon tasks
- **üõ†Ô∏è Native Tool Integration**: Real tsc, eslint, prettier execution via Moon tasks - not WASM parsing
- **üéØ Flexible Targeting**: Path filters, include/exclude patterns, file limits for precise control
- **üåÄ Non-Interactive**: One-shot automated fixing with JSON-based communication

## ‚úÖ ALLOWED Operations

- **Claude CLI Integration**: Claude CLI executed via Moon tasks with JSON communication - no file writing by Claude
- **File Operations**: Moon tasks handle all file reading, writing, and modifications
- **Moon Task Orchestration**: WASM coordinates with Moon tasks for native tool execution
- **JSON Protocol**: Structured communication between WASM extension and Moon tasks
- **Native Tool Execution**: Real TypeScript (tsc), ESLint, Prettier, Claude CLI execution via Moon tasks

## üîß MODIFICATION GUIDELINES

This is a **Moon extension package** - modifications should focus on Moon integration:
- **LLM Provider Expansion**: Add new AI providers through WASM-compatible interfaces
- **Moon Task Integration**: Enhance integration with Moon's task orchestration
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for WASM runtime and Moon's caching system
- **Extension Features**: Add Moon-specific features like project analysis and dependency awareness

### üåü **ESSENTIAL: Use Moon Commands for All Development**

**‚úÖ REQUIRED Moon Workflow:**
```bash
moon run moon-shine:build      # WASM compilation with intelligent caching
moon run moon-shine:test       # Test execution with dependency tracking
moon run moon-shine:lint       # Code quality with parallel execution
moon run moon-shine:type-check # TypeScript validation with Moon optimization
moon ext moon-shine src/       # Extension execution for development
```

**‚ùå AVOID Direct Commands (No Caching Benefits):**
```bash
# DON'T use these - they bypass Moon's intelligent caching:
# cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
# cargo test
# cargo clippy
# Use Moon orchestration instead!
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Dependencies

- **Moon Extension API**: Must conform to moonrepo extension interface
- **WASM Runtime**: Coordination logic must work within WASM sandbox constraints
- **Claude CLI**: Claude CLI execution via Moon tasks with JSON communication
- **Moon Tasks**: Native tool execution (tsc, eslint, prettier, claude) via Moon task system

### üåô Moon Extension Architecture

**Deployment Model**: Distributed as WASM extension to moonrepo users with intelligent orchestration

**Integration Points**:
- **üéØ Moon Tasks**: Deep integration with Moon's task orchestration and caching system
- **üîç Project Context**: Leverage Moon's project discovery and dependency graph analysis
- **üíæ Intelligent Caching**: Utilize Moon's dependency-aware caching for 10-100x performance
- **‚ö° CLI Interface**: Expose functionality through Moon's optimized CLI commands
- **ü§ñ MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol integration for AI agent coordination
- **üìä Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and trace profile generation

**Development Commands (Use These!):**
```bash
# Essential Moon workflow for developers and agents
moon run moon-shine:build       # Intelligent WASM compilation
moon run moon-shine:test        # Comprehensive testing with caching
moon run moon-shine:type-check  # TypeScript validation
moon run moon-shine:lint        # Code quality analysis
moon sync moon-shine            # Project state synchronization
moon query projects --id moon-shine --json  # Project introspection
```

## ü§ù Integration Context

**Standalone Moon Extension**:
- moon-shine **operates independently** within Moon's extension system
- **Direct AI processing** without external coordination requirements
- **Moon-native caching** and task integration for optimal performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Architecture

### WASM Extension Implementation
- **Pure Rust**: Compiled to WASM for Moon extension deployment
- **JSON Protocol**: Structured communication with Moon tasks via JSON protocol
- **Lightweight Dependencies**: Minimal WASM dependencies - Moon tasks handle heavy lifting
- **Moon Integration**: Native integration with Moon's extension API and task system

### Hybrid Architecture
- **WASM Coordination**: WASM extension coordinates workflow and basic analysis
- **Moon Task Execution**: Native tools (tsc, eslint, prettier, claude) executed via Moon tasks
- **JSON Communication**: Structured data exchange between WASM and Moon tasks
- **Caching Integration**: Leverage Moon's caching system for all tool results

## üöß Implementation Status
