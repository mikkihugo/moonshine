## 🔧 Deployment Workflow

### 1. Build Phase
```bash
./deployment/build-script.sh
```
- Compiles WASM with production optimizations
- Validates binary integrity
- Optimizes for size with wasm-opt
- Generates build artifacts

### 2. Test Phase
```bash
./deployment/test-extension.sh
```
- Validates WASM binary format
- Tests Moon integration
- Checks AI provider connectivity
- Verifies configuration files

### 3. Monitor Phase
```bash
./deployment/monitoring.sh check
./deployment/monitoring.sh continuous
```
- Health checks for all components
- AI provider status monitoring
- JSON health reporting
- Real-time monitoring dashboard

### 4. Package Phase
```bash
./deployment/package.sh
```
- Creates distribution archive
- Generates installation scripts
- Calculates checksums
- Produces deployment summary
