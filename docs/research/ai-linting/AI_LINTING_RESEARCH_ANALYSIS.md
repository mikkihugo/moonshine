- **Strategy**: Local model inference with caching
- **Fallback**: Cloud inference for complex analysis

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Target**: <30 seconds for full repository analysis
- **Strategy**: Parallel processing with model optimization
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling for large codebases

### 4.2 WASM Performance Benchmarks

Based on research findings:
- **SIMD Optimizations**: Up to 4x speedup for matrix operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Memory64 proposal for large models >4GB
- **FP16 Support**: 2x memory reduction and faster operations
- **Real-world Performance**: Often 1.75-2.5x slower than native, but acceptable for many use cases

### 4.3 Optimization Strategies

#### Model Optimization
```rust
// Example configuration for WASM deployment
pub struct WasmModelConfig {
    pub use_fp16: bool,           // Half precision for memory efficiency
    pub batch_size: usize,        // Optimize for single-file analysis
    pub cache_size: usize,        // LRU cache for frequent patterns
    pub simd_enabled: bool,       // Enable SIMD acceleration
}
```

#### Caching Strategies
1. **Pattern Caching**: Cache analysis results for common code patterns
2. **Model Caching**: Cache loaded models in memory
3. **Result Caching**: Cache AI suggestions for unchanged code
4. **Incremental Analysis**: Only analyze changed files

#### Performance Monitoring
```rust
pub struct AiLintingMetrics {
    pub inference_time_ms: u64,
    pub model_load_time_ms: u64,
    pub cache_hit_rate: f64,
    pub memory_usage_mb: f64,
    pub accuracy_score: f64,
}
```

### 4.4 Scaling Strategies

- **Implementation**: Background analysis with contextual triggers

#### Multi-Modal Interaction
```typescript
interface AiSuggestionInterface {
  // Real-time completions
  autoComplete: (context: CodeContext) => Suggestion[];

  // Chat-based interaction
  chatAssistant: (query: string, files: File[]) => Response;

  // Command-based fixes
  executeCommand: (command: string, selection: CodeSelection) => Fix[];

  // Contextual actions
  contextualActions: (position: Position) => Action[];
}
```

#### Privacy-Preserving Design
- **Local Processing**: Sensitive code analysis on-device
- **Opt-in Cloud**: Optional cloud enhancement for complex analysis

```typescript
// VSCode-style inline suggestion
interface InlineSuggestion {
  range: Range;
  text: string;
  confidence: number;
  source: 'ai' | 'static' | 'hybrid';
  autoApplicable: boolean;
}
```

#### Contextual Panels
- **Problems Panel**: Enhanced with AI explanations and fixes
- **Quick Fix Menu**: AI-powered suggestions alongside traditional fixes
- **Hover Information**: Rich context from AI analysis

#### Progressive Disclosure
1. **Level 1**: Simple fix suggestions (high confidence)
2. **Level 2**: Detailed explanations (medium confidence)
3. **Level 3**: Alternative approaches (exploratory)

### 5.3 Trust and Confidence Building

#### Transparency Indicators
```typescript
interface SuggestionMetadata {
  confidence: number;        // 0.0 - 1.0
  reasoning: string;         // Explanation of suggestion
  sources: string[];         // What data informed the suggestion
  alternatives: Suggestion[]; // Other possible suggestions
  impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'; // Potential impact of change
}
```

#### Feedback Mechanisms
- **Accept/Reject Tracking**: Learn from user decisions
- **Explanation Requests**: Allow users to ask "why?"
- **Custom Rules**: Let users create rules from AI suggestions

#### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to traditional linting
- **Error Explanation**: Clear error messages for AI failures
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Intelligent retry with exponential backoff
